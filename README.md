These are personal projects primarily utilizing a combination of webscraping and machine learning.  My primary professional interest is in biosensor development and geospatial modeling, specifically in agricultural and environmental applications.  

Within this repository is code associated with the following.
-  Forecasting citrus yields by county utilizing NDVI images and weather data.
-  Scraping public internet resources to identify trends in foodborne outbreaks at Chiptole restaurants.
-  A twitter bot that utilizes NLP methods to appropriately respond to tweets with Dr. Evil quotes.
-  Web scrapers for Zillow / Redfin to identify real estate trends by sampling within a given geography and analyzing changes sales, appraisal, and listings on a price per sq ft basis.
